<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a current university student at the University of Texas at Arlington. I orginally came to UT Arlington to pursue a degree in aerospace engineering but decided to change my major to my secondary love, technology. I am passonate about learning new things
  related to technology and am having quite a bit of fun exploring HTML and CSS. It is very exciting to see something be formed from nothing and sit back to realize that I am the one who did it! Like man, how cool is that!!
</p>

<p>My first and true passion is aviation. I can talk your ear off all day with pretty much anything aviation you would like to know. I love the learn everything I can about anything that flies. While I do have my favorite type of aircraft,
  mostly being military fighters, I seriously haven't found a single aircraft that I don't like. As far as what intrigues me about aviation, well I don't actually know, it's something to do with the general question of, "How can we take something that is so 
  heavy, so metallic, and get enough speed behind it with the particular right shape of some longer thin metal, and boom you have vertical lift and flight, how does this work?" It's seriously miraculous to me, and I absolutely do plan to get my private 
  pilot license soon, hopefully as soon as I am done with school.

<p>Interesting things about me is that I am an identical twin. I would also like to go ahead and dispel some rumors, no I can't read his mind, eventhough we do happen to say the same things sometimes. Second, no we haven't ever switched places
  to see if someone would notice. I'm sure there are some other random questions I've been asked before but they are slipping me so that's all for now.
